# DC Voltage Box
This project aims to develop a circuit box capable of providing both positive and negative DC voltage outputs.
This circuit box supports two output modes. One mode provides a relatively low current output of approximately Å}2V DC. The other mode delivers a higher current DC output ranging from 3V to 5V. The high-current mode can be turned ON and OFF via microcontroller control.
